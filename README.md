# Learning Objectives

###What Bash scripting should not be used for
Bash scripting is better suited for automating repetitive tasks and managing system configurations.

###What is an API
Application Programming Interface is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

###What is a REST API
Representational State Transfer API is a type of web API that follows the principles of REST. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for communication and usually returns data in a JSON format.

### What are microservices

Microservices are a way of designing and building software applications as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

###What is the CSV format
Comma-Separated Values is a simple file format used to store tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text. Each line of the file represents a row of the table, and the values within a row are separated by commas.

###What is the JSON format
JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data interchange format. It is easy to read and write, and it is easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON data is represented as key-value pairs and is often used in web APIs.

###Pythonic Package and module name style
Should be lowercase with underscores between words, following the "snake_case" convention. e.g. `my_module` or `my_package`.

###Pythonic Class name style
CapWords/CamelCase is where the initial letter of each word is capitalised. e.g. `MyClass` or `CarModel`.

###Pythonic Variable name style
Following the "snake_case" convention. e.g. `my_variable` or `count_total`.

###Pythonic Function name style
Follow the "snake_case" convention. e.g. `calculate_sum` or `process_data`.

###Pythonic Constant name style
For variables whose values should not be changed, should be uppercase with underscores. e.g. `MAX_VALUE` or `PI`.

###Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
CapWords/CamelCase is used in Python to make class names easily recognisable and distinguishable from functions and variables. It helps improve the readability of code, especially in object-oriented programming, where classes play a significant role.
